# Plausible CLI (work in progress)

This repository hosts an upcoming Rust-based command-line interface for Plausible Analytics.

Current documentation drafts:
- `docs/architeture.md` – architectural overview, command surface, diagrams.
- `docs/000-v1-plan.md` – delivery roadmap, testing strategy, release plan.

More content will land as we implement the v1 roadmap.
